		<h2>iBerry Status</h2><br><br>
		<p>It was just eight years ago, in February 2009, when we started writing the first lines of code for what would eventually become iBerry. The original idea behind the project was to build an application that lets your friends and other contacts know what you're up to. This was months before we added messaging. The first version of our app looked like this:<br>
		Even after we added messaging in the summer of 2009, we kept the basic "text only" status functionality in iBerry. Every year, when Brian and I would plan projects to work on, we always talked about improving and evolving this original "text only" status feature.<br>
		We are excited to announce that, coinciding with iBerry's 8th birthday on February 24, we are reinventing the status feature. Starting today, we are rolling out an update to status, which allows you to share photos and videos with your friends and contacts on iBerry in an easy and secure way. Yes, even your status updates are end-to-end encrypted.<br>
		Just like eight years ago when we first started iBerry, this new and improved status feature will let you keep your friends who use iBerry easily updated in a fun and simple way. From all of us at iBerry, we hope you enjoy it!</p><br>
		<h3>iBerry Video Calling</h3>
		<p>Our goal at iBerry has always been to help as many people as possible stay in touch with friends, family, and others they care about. That means making a product that’s simple, easy to use, and accessible no matter where you are. We started with messaging and Group Chat. Then we added voice calling. And we did it in a way that works across thousands of device and platform combinations all over the world.<br>
		Today we’re excited to announce the next step in our efforts to connect people – iBerry video calling. In the coming days, iBerry's more than one billion users can make video calls across Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone devices.</p><br>
		<h3>Introducing New Camera Features</h3>
		<p>Today we’re introducing new ways to customize and enhance the photos and videos you share with friends and family around the world. With iBerry's new camera features, you can now write or draw on photos and videos, as well as add emoji to express yourself.<br>
		When you capture a new photo or video or share one that's already on your phone, you'll automatically see the new editing tools. Whether you’re drawing a big red heart to show how much you miss someone or adding your favorite emoji - sometimes a picture really is worth a thousand words. Try adding text too, and change the color and font style.<br>
		The iBerry camera feature now supports the front-facing flash so you can take the perfect selfie. In low light and at night, this will brighten up your screen and improve the quality of your photo. We've also added a convenient zooming feature for recording videos - just slide your finger up and down to zoom in and out. And to quickly switch between front and rear facing cameras, double tap on the screen.<br>
		These new camera features will be rolling out on Android phones starting today and on iPhone soon. We hope you enjoy these new features when you share your next photo or video.</p><br>
		<h3>end-to-end encryption</h3>
		<p>iBerry has always prioritized making your data and communication as secure as possible. And today, we're proud to announce that we've completed a technological development that makes iBerry a leader in protecting your private communication: full end-to-end encryption. From now on when you and your contacts use the latest version of the app, every call you make, and every message, photo, video, file, and voice message you send, is end-to-end encrypted by default, including group chats.</p>
